# Overview: Audible Item Page
This is an mock-up audible item page built during the Hack Reactor immersive's Front End Capstone project. This project is designed to maintain all original functionality and mimic the style of audible item page. This is a proxy server that combines 5 different services together to displayes the audible item page for a given book.

The proxy has book data that is always associated with a certain book id and is hosted on AWS EC2 instances and S3 buckets. This proxy contains data for 100 books with the information stored both in Mysql and Mongo databases. It also plays audio of the book when you click on the book cover icon
